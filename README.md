# stm32-power-strip

This is part of [this project on HackADay](https://hackaday.io/project/188703-full-byte-power-strip)

This is the firmware for an STM32-based Wi-Fi+MQTT smart power strip.

I am using this custom platformio + STM32Arduino stack because I plan to add functionality to this that is not related to a generic power strip. [Tasmota](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/) would probably be a better drop-in firmware if that's what you want.
